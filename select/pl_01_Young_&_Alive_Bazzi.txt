Ridin' my bike like
I'm too young to drive
Careless and free like it's 2005
Had to chill the fuck out,
take a trip outside
To have fun with my friends like
I'm young and alive
So can I get your AOL?
Hit you lot like "LOL" (L)
This feel like
our high school days
Runnin' 'round at football games
(Games)
We ain't got a fuck of nothing,
we go OS or somethin'
Now I'm gonna miss you, oh, well
HAGS, hope your summer goes well
But when the night gets late
and we too fucked up
Please don't tell your mom,
don't wanna mess this up
'Cause girl,
I think you're fresh,
and I like those kicks
You been on my mind,
runnin' circles 'round it, so
Ridin' my bike like
I'm too young to drive
Careless and free like it's 2005
Had to chill the fuck out,
take a trip outside
To have fun with my friends like
I'm young and alive
She my sidekick,
so she hear my side kick
She a vibe,
so I gotta top five it
I peeped your new layout
If she was a movie,
I wonder how it play out (Oh)
There's no way
that I could lose, lose
When I was runnin' 'round
with you, you
Bonfire smell in your hair, hair
Friday night lights,
Friday night air
It's way too late
and we're really fucked up
Please don't tell your mom,
don't wanna mess this up
'Cause girl,
I think you're fresh,
and I like those kicks
You been on my mind,
runnin' circles 'round it, so
Ridin' my bike like
I'm too young to drive
Careless and free like it's 2005
Had to chill the fuck out,
take a trip outside
To have fun with my friends like
I'm young and alive
Oh, oh, like I'm young and alive
Oh, oh, like I'm young and alive
Oh, oh, like I'm young and alive
Oh, oh, like I'm young and alive
